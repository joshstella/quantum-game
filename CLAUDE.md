# CLAUDE.md

Project instructions for Claude Code. Adapt the project-specific sections below to this
repo; the process rules in the first section apply unchanged.

## Process — use the skills, don't go around them

This repo uses the claude-process-automation workflow. The installed skills are the gates;
bypassing them is the defect.

- **`/commit-push-pr`** — the only path to `main`. It runs the review gate before
  committing. Never use raw `git commit && git push` for work headed to `main`.
- **`/review-pr`** — called automatically by `/commit-push-pr`. Can also be run manually
  on a PR number or the staged diff.
- **`/create-brief`** — file a draft into `docs/briefs/`. Non-trivial work gets a brief
  before it starts, not after.
- **`/start-brief` / `/next-brief-phase`** — initiate and continue phased work.
- **`/chronicle`** — generate a narrative history from briefs, ledgers, and git. Run when
  you want the story of how the codebase got here.
- **`/init-briefs`** — one-time setup. Already run if `docs/briefs/` exists.

## Working style

- **Direct challenge over affirmation.** Say when something is wrong and why. Skip
  flattery and padding.
- **Surface friction, don't smooth it.** If two goals conflict or a requirement is
  incoherent, name the tension — that's the useful signal.
- **One change at a time.** Single fix, shown, waited on. If a task implies many edits,
  propose the sequence first.
- **Ask rather than guess** on judgment calls that turn on intent or domain knowledge.
  Mark every assumption inline so it can be corrected.

## Tests

Tests gate `main`. Code merges to `main` only with tests covering it — unit for logic,
integration across boundaries — run and passing. Write them as you go. A genuinely
untestable merge (pure config, generated boilerplate) gets an explicit "test-exempt
because…" in the PR, not a silent gap.

## Code style

- Strongly typed at every boundary. No `any`. Explicit named exported interfaces.
- Generate types from schemas (JSON Schema, DB schema) rather than hand-writing parallel
  interfaces that can drift.
- Comment the *why*, not the *what*. A non-obvious constraint or workaround is worth a
  comment; what the code does is already in the code.
- No speculative abstractions. No error handling for scenarios that can't happen.

## Project-specific

<!-- Add stack, build commands, architecture notes, and project-specific rules here. -->

```bash
# Example — replace with real commands:
# npm run dev      # dev server
# npm test         # test suite
# npm run build    # production build
```
