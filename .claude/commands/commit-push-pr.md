Stage changed files, review them **before anything leaves the machine**, and only commit + push + open a PR if the review passes.
The review is a gate, not a formality: a `Request changes` verdict stops the chain before the commit. Nothing reaches the remote unreviewed.
Steps:
0. **Preflight — stop here if either check fails:**
   - Run `gh auth status` to confirm gh is installed and authenticated. If it fails or shows no active account, stop and tell the user to run `brew install gh && gh auth login` before continuing.
   - Run `git branch --show-current`. If it is `main` or `master`, stop and tell the user a PR cannot be created from the default branch — they should create a feature branch first (`git checkout -b <name>`).
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand what changed.
2. Run `git log -5 --oneline` to match the repo's commit message style.
3. Stage the relevant files (prefer specific file names over `git add -A` — exclude anything that looks like secrets, generated output, or build artefacts).
4. **Review gate — before commit, before push.** Invoke `/review-pr --staged` explicitly by name on the staged diff. Wait for its verdict.
   - **Request changes** → STOP. Do not commit. Do not push. Surface the findings to the user and end the chain. The files stay staged; the user fixes, re-stages, and re-runs this command. (If the user prefers, they can ask you to fix the findings and re-run the gate — but do not auto-fix and self-clear without being asked; that defeats the gate.)
   - **Approve** or **Approve with suggestions** → continue. Carry any suggestions into the final response so the user sees them even though they didn't block.
5. Write a commit message that captures the *why*, not just the what. One concise subject line; add a short body if the change needs context. End with:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   Then commit.
6. Push to the current branch (with `-u origin <branch>` if the branch has no upstream yet).
7. Create a PR with `gh pr create`. Pass the body via HEREDOC so formatting is preserved.
   - **Title** under 70 characters. If this work executes a brief, prefix the title with the brief's serial in brackets: `[#NNNN] <summary>`. Derive `NNNN` from the active brief — the branch name if it leads with a four-digit serial, otherwise the `docs/briefs/NNNN-slug/` folder being executed. For ad-hoc work not tied to a brief, omit the prefix and title as usual. (Because main is squash-merged, the title becomes the commit subject on main, so `[#NNNN]` lands in the permanent history and any commit traces back to the brief that specified it.)
   The body must include:
   - `## Summary` — 2–4 bullets.
   - `## Test plan` — how it was/should be verified, naming the tests added. If the change is genuinely test-exempt (pure config, generated boilerplate), write "test-exempt because…" here instead. This line is the record `/review-pr` checks — a silent absence of tests reads as a missing-tests block.
   - `## Brief` — the governing brief and phase this work came from, as serial + path: `#NNNN — docs/briefs/NNNN-slug/brief.md — phase <N>`. Write `none` if this change isn't from a brief. This line is what lets `/review-pr` find the intent to check against later.
8. Return the PR URL, plus the review verdict and any carried-forward suggestions, in the same response.
Do not amend existing commits. If the pre-commit hook fails, fix the issue and create a new commit.
